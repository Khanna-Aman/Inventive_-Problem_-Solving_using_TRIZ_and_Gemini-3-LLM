# Inventive Problem Solving Using TRIZ and LLM

## Overview

This project explores the integration of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) methodology with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance creative problem-solving capabilities.

## About TRIZ

TRIZ is a systematic methodology for inventive problem-solving developed by Genrich Altshuller. It provides a structured approach to innovation by:

- Identifying and resolving contradictions
- Applying 40 inventive principles
- Utilizing patterns of technical evolution
- Leveraging knowledge from diverse fields

## Project Goals

- Combine TRIZ principles with LLM capabilities for enhanced problem-solving
- Develop tools and frameworks for systematic innovation
- Create practical applications for real-world problem-solving scenarios

## Getting Started
